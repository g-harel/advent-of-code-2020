## Testing

Solution correctness is verified using standard Go test infra.

```sh
go test ./...
```

## Dev

Common helper functions and utils are placed in the [`./lib`](./lib) directory.

Use the helper to create the boilerplate solution/test files and an empty text file to paste the input.

```sh
./new.sh <day-number>
```
